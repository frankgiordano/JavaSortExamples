# JavaSortExamples

The following project demonstrates ways how sorting can be performed in Java. 

The first is the old way legacy with comparable interface.

The second uses Google's Gauvu Libary with a comparator interface and shows a much easier and cleaner way to sort.

The third uses Google's Gauvu Libaray with some Java 8 features and shows a much streamline way and remove all the boiler plate code. 

The fourth usues Java 8's Comparator.comparing() method. 

This project was used for a presentation at LI java meetup:
