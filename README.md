# JavaSortExamples

The following project has three packages to show the way sorting can be done. 

The first is the old way legacy with comparable interface.

The second uses Google's Gauvu Libary with a comparator interface and shows a much easier and cleaner way to sort.

The third uses Google's Gauvu Libaray with some Java 8 features and shows a much streamline way and remove all the boiler plate code.
